# Data-module
_The data-module stores data aswell as handle file write/read with a custom json-serializer_

## Serializers and de-serializers
The classes that need to be saved and or written to have their own serializer and de-serializer classes under `/data/src/main/java/data/`. These classes parse data in json format to `/data/src/main/resources/` so they can be stored in memory for later retrieval.
